# Machine Learning Algorithms Visualization (Shiny for Python)
Interactive Shiny app that demonstrates how machine learning algorithms work by visualizing them.

## About

This project focuses on building intuition for machine learning by showing how models update in real time through interactive visualizations.

All algorithms are implemented from scratch. This means no ML libraries were used for the models. However, I only used scikit-learn for `make_blobs` to generate isotropic Gaussian blobs for K-Means clustering visualization. The models themselves were made with just *numpy*.
