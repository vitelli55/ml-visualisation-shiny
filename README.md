# Machine Learning Algorithms Visualization (Shiny for Python)
Interactive Shiny app that demonstrates how machine learning algorithms work by visualizing them.

## About

This project focuses on building intuition for machine learning by showing how models update in real time through interactive visualizations.

All algorithms are implemented from scratch. This means no ML libraries were used for the models. However, I only used scikit-learn for `make_blobs` to generate isotropic Gaussian blobs for K-Means clustering visualization. The models themselves were made with just *numpy*.

## Features

* Interactive sliders and inputs
* Step-by-step training visualization
* Randomise data or upload your own CSV file

## Purpose

My goal with this project is to:
* Strengthen my foundational ML understanding
* Build algorithms from first principles
* Hopefully help others to visualise how these algorithms work.

## References

This project was developed as a learning exercise.  
Models and mathematical explanations were studied from:
- *Data Science from Scratch* by Joel Grus  
- YouTube videos on machine learning in Python, such as *NeuralNine* and *Andy McDonald*
